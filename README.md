## Home automation project

In the `Progetto` folder you can find the project assigned for the course.

The project revolves around a home automation system, with devices such as bulbs and windows represented as UNIX processes and managed by a tree-structured control system. 

Information (in Italian) about the assignment itself can be found in the `Progetto/documents/` sub-folder. The `ProgettoSO.pdf` is the initial task, while `readme.pdf` is an overview of (Paolo, Ruben and mine)'s implementation with details about the protocol used.

To get started, simply move to the `Progetto` folder and type `make`.
